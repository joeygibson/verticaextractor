# Ideas

* If a query file is given, use that to determine the tables/columns/quantity to read
* ~~If no query, accept a table name, an read a certain number of rows, including all columns~~
* ~~Accept an argument for how many rows to read~~
* ~~Require an argument specifying the output file name~~
* Would it be useful to read a CSV file, and write out native?
